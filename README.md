## Setup and Configuration Guide
You can get started on developing this application by following a few steps:
- Just clone this repository.
- Open in ANdroid Studio.

## Design
I have followed the following standard design practices for this project:
- Separation of ui and logic. The ui strictly only communicates with the viewmodel and is unaware of business logic.
- Integration of hilt for easier dependency injection.
- Usage of Jetpack compose for ui development.
- Interfaces created to abstract out the logic for network implementations.
